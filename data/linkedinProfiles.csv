😱 Exciting Update on Llama 3!
I'm diving into a weekend side project to further enhance the capabilities of Llama 3 for the open-source community.
With its new function calling and JSON mode features, the potential for innovation just skyrocketed!
Stay tuned for updates as I explore ways to push the boundaries of what Llama 3 can do. Let's make it even more powerful together!

Function calling is an essential feature that allows language models to interact with external applications and APIs. Currently, as far as my research goes, there are no Vietnamese language models that support this feature. Therefore, I have fine-tuned a model on Vistral to include this capability. If you are interested in this functionality, feel free to try it out and provide me with feedback. Thank you.
