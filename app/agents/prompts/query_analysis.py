Return a JSON object following these rules:
For each relationship to analyze, add a key-value pair with the key being an exact match for one of the entity types provided, and the value being the value relevant to the user query.

For the example provided, the expected output would be:
{{
    "age": "under 40",
    "location": "Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"
    "years_of_experience": "10+ years",
